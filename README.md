# The TaskBoard 

The main goal of "The TaskBoard" project is task management.
The user can manage both personal tasks and collective ones. Set deadlines, assess the quality of execution, change the executor, and so on. 

In this project I mastered:
- Spring Boot;
- Spring Boot Actuator;
- Spring Security;
- Spring Data JPA;
- Thymeleaf;
- Hibernate validator;
- PostgreSQL Driver.
